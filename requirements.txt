# Core deep learning framework
# IMPORTANT: PyTorch installation is platform and CUDA-version specific.
# It's highly recommended to install PyTorch first by following the
# instructions on the official PyTorch website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# The lines below are placeholders; pip install -r requirements.txt might
# install a CPU-only version or a version not matching your CUDA setup
# if PyTorch isn't already installed correctly.
